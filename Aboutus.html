                <h3>Who are we Tofunmi Meat Ventures is an agriculture company registered to the Nigerian Corporate Affairs Commission since 2020. Hitherto, we were a one-person pig farming business operating since 2020 out of the ile oluji settlement, Ondo State.
 
                    We set up a proper farm management structure right after the African Swine Flu (ASF) epidemic — which infected animals in the farm after the Covid-19 pandemic — that resulted in the death of 90% of pigs in Nigeria.
                    
                    At Supreme Meat Ventures, our diverse team of seasoned livestock farmers and agriculture experts specialize in setting up farms for either individuals or businesses branching out into pig farming. We also provide animals, feed, and farmhands to facilitate the smooth running of our clients’ farms, enabling them to turn a profit.</h3>

               <h2>Our Mission</h2>
               <p>Tofunmi Meat Ventures is committed to addressing the massive decline in the local supply of pigs caused by Covid-19 and the African Swine Flu. The disparity between the demand and supply of pigs is wider now than ever before, as many pig farmers and farmhands — waylaid by the pandemic — remain unemployed.

                To tackle this unemployment problem, we employ as many farmhands as possible and empower farmers with invaluable hygienic and bio-security measures global health experts proposed to curb the African Swine Flu menace.</p>

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>To leverage the funds the farms we empower need to rear animals effectively and sustain best farm practices, which comprise proper hygiene, high-quality feed, and quality care to provide first-grade cuts.

                    While the local scramble to curb the African Swine Flu is still ongoing, we aim to breed as many pigs as possible to meet the overwhelming demand for pigs and pork today.
                    
                    We hope to build our chain store butchery, where anyone can walk in to purchase pork at a fair and affordable price.</p>
